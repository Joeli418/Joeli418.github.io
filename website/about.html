		<h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>We believe that everyone can do well in math if they are engaged and practice hard enough</p>
        <p>Practicing can be very tough. One may experience boredem, difficulty, loneliness and repetitiveness of doing revision.</p>
        <p>
            Our main objective is to develope interactive tutoring sessions and game systems to assist students in studying math.
            We understand the effectiveness of studying can be boosted in many ways, such as interactive learning, revision in groups, 
            and award systems. These method will be taken into account while.
        </p>
        <p>
            We also value individual's well being and offer mental support if one is struggling hard in his/her journey.
            We acknowledge it's not always the final results that matters the most.

		<h2>How Tutoring Sessions Work?</h2>
        <p>Tutoring will be mainly conducted on Discord or Zoom</p>
        <p>
            Note tutoring comes in class, meaning groups of students can join classes. 
            When payment is recieved, student recieve a "ticket" which he/she can use to join a class when the topic matches his/her needs.
            Tickets will be preserved if students did not use it, and can be used in another class.
        </p>
        <p>
            Tutoring sessions will very occassionally include interactive platforms such as kahoots or poll everywhere. 
            This will very well ensure that students are highly engaged in the tutoring sessions. 
            Students will be awarded currency under well performance.
        </p>
        <p>
            A long term payment from a group will provide the group a "boat". 
            This is a game system which boat battles in arena. The boat progress as the group submits more proof of math revision.
            Boat will battle against each other in the arena to fight for their currencies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currencies can be used to exchange actual prizes
        </p>
