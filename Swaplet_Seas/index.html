		<h3>Join us in the Swaplet Seas tutoring to make your journey of studying math alot more adventurous and fun.</h3>

		<h3>We have a range of ways to promote studying.</h3> 
		<p> This includes but are not limited to: </p>
		<ul>
			<li><b> Interactive Tutoring Session </b>
				<p>
					We do realize we learn more by doing stuff rather then being spoon fed one hour of lesson stream each week.
					we will make our lessons interactive and engaging as we could get.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b> Game System </b>
				<p>
					The main way to learn maths effectively is to practice. To make practicing less dull and more engaging, 
					we will have mini math games during sessions and long games to encourage practicing.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b> Rewards and Prices </b>
				<p>Positive Reinforcement is a good way to encourage practicing. We will use a part of our income to make or buy prices for our students
					prices will be a part of award of our game.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li><b> Group Working </b>
				<p>
					 Being alone is very tough. Especially when it comes to doing revision. It requires a high amount of discipline.
					 We encourage students to work together as a team to support each other in their journey and thrive the best.</p>
			</li>
			<li><b> Moral Support </b>
				<p>
					We've been there before and understand HSC journey is not some easy task we can breeze through. We can offer help for whoever feeling
					discourage despite trying very hard.
